    <p>Quests are an important source of gems, speedups, and resources. If you want to jump up those leaderboards, you should attempt to complete as many quests as possible. Ranking on the quest leaderboard as often as possible is also beneficial to gaining might more quickly and ranking higher daily.</p>

    <p>All quests are 55 minutes long and begin at five past the hour.</p>

    <p>Quests repeat every 11 hours. Some quests, such as troop training and monster slaying, occur more often than others.</p>

    <p>To earn points in a quest you need to finish an activity within the allotted timeframe. Beginning gathering resources, construction, research, or training troops before the quest starts is a good strategy to get an edge up on the competition.</p>

    <p>You are only competing against other users in your bracket range in your realm. The brackets are based on Town Hall level as follows:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>TH 3&ndash;6</li>

        <li>TH 7&ndash;9</li>

        <li>TH 10&ndash;12</li>

        <li>TH 13&ndash;15</li>

        <li>TH 16&ndash;18</li>

        <li>TH 19&ndash;22</li>

        <li>TH 23&ndash;25</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Basic rewards are offered for one star, two stars, or three stars on each quest. These are important and can help build the gems and speedups you need to top the quest leaderboards.</p>

    <p>The best rewards are given for ranking in the top 3 on the leaderboards. You should aim to rank 1st place on a quest every so often. Make sure you have enough resources / gems / speedups to rank on the leaderboard before you begin!</p><script>
