    <p>Quests are an important source of gems, speedups and resources. If you want to jump up those leaderboards you need to complete as many quests as possible.</p>

    <p>All quests are 55 minutes long starting at five past the hour.</p>

    <p>Quests repeat every 11 hours. Some quests such as troop training and monster slaying occur more often than others.</p>

    <p>To earn points in a quest you need to finish an activity within the quest period. Starting gather resources, construction, research or train troops before the quest starts is a good strategy to get an edge.</p>

    <p>You are only competing against other users in your realm and in your bracket range. The brackets are based on Town Hall level.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>TH 3&ndash;6</li>
        <li>TH 7&ndash;9</li>
        <li>TH 10&ndash;12</li>
        <li>TH 13&ndash;15</li> 
        <li>TH 16&ndash;18</li> 
        <li>TH 19&ndash;22</li> 
        <li>TH 23&ndash;25</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Basic rewards are on offer for one star, two star or three stars on each quest. These are important and can help build the gems / speedups you need to top the quest leaderboards.</p>

    <p>The best rewards are given for coming top 3 on the leaderboards. You should always aim to hit 1st on a quest every so often. Make sure you have enough resources / gems / speedups before you start!</p>
